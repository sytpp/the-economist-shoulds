'The Economist Shoulds' was a mini project, a technical pitch for an internship. I wanted to demonstrate simple
text processing using R and have a go at playing with D3.

Anyone who reads the Economist regularly might at some point feel like you're being lectured by your dad. 
The Economist, pretty much always, knows who should do what. This prescriptive style obviously goes along 
with the authority the paper aims to represent. Nevertheless, there is defintely reasons and scope to make
fun of it.

Analysing 1 years worth of articles from the Economist, I wanted to know "who should do what?". I therefore
extracted all sentences which contained the word 'should' and visualised the result in an interactive graphic.
I am showing the number of prescriptive sentences per week and colour-code them by the respective section.
In addtion, I allow for search accross these sentences, so we can easily look up what the Economist recommends
"Merkel", "Putin" or whoever SHOULD do.
